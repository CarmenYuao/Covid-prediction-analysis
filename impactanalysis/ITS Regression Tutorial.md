# ITS Regression Tutorial Concern

**The intervention**: The intervention does not need to be introduced overnight but *the period of implementation should be well defined.*

**The outcome**: 
* prefer short-term outcomes expected to change either *relatively quickly* after an intervention is implemented or after *a clearly defined lag*. 
* not prefer timing between intervention and outcome is much less clear and can be highly variable(should consider intermediate outcome here).


whether the change will be?
* trend
* level 
* both


prior decision based on 
*existing literature
*knowledge of the intervention and the mechanism by which it is expected to act on the outcome.

Relying on the outcome data to select the best impact model will increase the likelihood of an effect being detected due to random fluctuation or chance.

the population may change(though this is not essential if the population is relatively stable over time)


seasonality causes problems
* if there is an uneven distribution of monthes before and after the intervention, this could bias the results, especially in the analysis of short series.
* outcomes tend to be more similar to those in neighbouring months with the same time of year, leading to auto-correlation & over-dispersion.
