# Imperfectly Identifiable Natural Events
 
Problem: while the time of onset is not clear, the ITSA model-building process is more **exploratory** than **confirmatory**. Poorly defined or incorrect dates necessarily lead to a wider range of possible models.



**Assumption**:

* the point of occurrence of the event is known
* a specific functional form be specified for the effect that the event has on the time series.


**Notice**: 

* Many researchers recommend against the use of ITSA in not clearly defined occurence of the event.
* the functional form is often defined by the researchers after inspection of the data, and a variety of candidate transfer functions may be fitted to the data. 





### Defining & Dating an unplanned event
**Problem**: Poorly defined or incorrect dates necessarily lead to a wider range of possible models

the point of onset of the event is unknown must be inferred from data sources that are independent of the time series data that will be used for the ITSA.

* other papers
* expertise
A Variety of data sources were cross-referenced to establish a likely onset date.

### Choosing indicator data
**Problem**: Results may be biased 

* if the available data do not represent a properly random sample of all available data
* represents only specific sub-populations of events. 


**indicator data**(the preferred data for ITSA with poorly defined events):

* a complete sample of all recorded events of interests or a properlt random subsample of these events
* data which was not collected solely for the purpose of monitoring the event
* recorded in same way across the entire period of data collection.

**Notice**: the data used in ITSA for assessing the effect of intervention should not be used to identify its timing.

### Modelling the effect of the unplanned intervention
The process of developing a functional form of the intervention was necessarily exploratory. 

### Evaluating rival explanation
**Problem**: If the timing of the intervention is not clearly defined, the possibility that its effects have a rival explanation increases.

plausible rival explanations Here

* a change occurred in the process of measuring the time series at approximately the same time as the intervention.
* there was confounding by other interventions that occurred concurrently with intervention that may have affect the time series.

Rule Out Rival Explanation:

* *Independent data* that provides an insight into the behaviour of the time series
* *Existing research* in the field and related fields;
* The views of *independent experts* not involved in the research project who have an understanding of the dynamics of the process being studied
